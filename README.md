# The Summary Assessment

Ready to put your skills to the test and have some full-stack hacking fun? This assessment is like a day long solo sprint where you get to build a full stack JavaScript application from scratch using the skills and technologies you've worked with during the first half of the course. Expect to reinforce concepts and techniques you are familiar with and also to learn some new content.


## Before Getting Started

1. Get a USB flash drive from a proctor
1. Confirm that all communication applications and tools are turned off, closed, put away
1. Fork this repo and clone it
1. Follow [these instructions](http://bookstrap.hackreactor.com/wiki/How-to-Record-Your-Screen.md) to start recording your screen


## How To Start This App

YOU MUST FILL THIS SECTION OUT BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR WORK


## Requirements

Implement a full-stack application based on the images in `mockups/`

- [ ] Use Angular, Backbone, or React to create a single page front-end
- [ ] Use a Node server (with Express if you'd like)
- [ ] Use a SQL or Mongo database to persist all data (with ORMs if you'd like)
- [ ] Fill out the script, `seed.js`, that is responsible for seeding your database with example data from `data.json`
- [ ] Fill out the [How To Start This App](#how-to-start-this-app) section with instructions that can be understood by another developer

Additionally, be sure to update `.gitignore` if you choose to move the installation location of `node_modules` or `bower_components`

## Guidelines

You must manage your time effectively to complete this assessment. Follow these guidelines to help you manage your time:

* **Plan first**. A solid gameplan will help you stay on track
* **Do not grind.** If you're stuck, move on to a different part and come back to it later
* **Attempt every part of the stack.** An incomplete solution with pseudocode will score better than a non-existent one
* **Prioritize technology choices for efficient development.** If you're comfortable with your tools, you'll move fast
* **Use Iterative Development.** You don't have time to perfect one feature at the expense of the other ones

These prompts will be evaluated as if they were coding challenges given to you as part of a job application process. Not only will the functionality of your code be important, but also, the professionalism with which you write it. Consider the style and organization of your code. Make frequent commits with informative and consistent commit messages. Be professional and informative with your comments.


## Available resources

* You **may not** use a scaffolding tool (e.g. Yeoman) or starter repos
* You **may not** use any resources created at Hack Reactor by yourself, other students, or staff members
  * e.g. lectures, sprints, MVP, past assessments, side projects, notes, mentor assignments, etc.
* You **may** use other online resources such as Google, Stack Overflow, library documentation
* You **may not** copy and paste from available online resources


## Submitting Solutions

Your work will be submitted with the help of a script located in the root directory of this repo. After completing your work:

1. Stop recording your screen and save your video file locally as `firstname-lastname-yyyymmdd`
1. Copy your local screen recording video to the USB flash drive your proctor provided
1. Fill out the `closing_comments.txt` file
1. Fill out the "How to start this app" section
1. Run the script `bash submit.sh`. When prompted to see a proctor, bring them your flash drive
